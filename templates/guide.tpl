				It is hoped that the site will be relatively intuitive for the majority of users,
				obviating the need for an entire manual.  If something is very important to know
				then there will generally be some instructions or tips at the appropriate
				place in the user interface.

				The site can certainly be useful to those who don't create an account, but without
				logging in one is limited to doing one-off searches and trying to build recipes that
				will disappear once you leave the site. Logging in allows you to save your receipes
				for future reference.

			<div class='standardMargins'>
				A recipe
				is just a collection of an arbitrary number of individual foods.  Once a recipe has
				been created, you can view the entire nutritional profile for all of the ingredients
				together.  Ingredients can be added to or taken away
				from an existing recipe at any time, and existing recipes can be used as templates for
				creating new, similar ones.
			</div>

			<div class='standardMargins'>
				Foods and recipes that users find and save are searchable by everyone.  What this
				means is that the more people use the site, the more foods and recipes will be
				searchable by everyone.
